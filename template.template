      <div >
        <!-- <p> <i>"We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.” (Russell-Einstein Manifesto, 1955)</i> -->

        <p><b>To:</b> <i>Fremont Board of Education President Desiree Campbell; Board of Education Members Larry Sweeney, Ann Crosbie, Dianne Jones, Michele Berke, and Student Member Zayaan Khan; and Fremont Unified School District Acting Superintendent Raul Zamora</i></p>

        <p>The senseless murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Trayvon Martin, and countless other Black folks have shocked the nation. They have reaffirmed the reality that systemic racism exists in every community. They have reminded us that we all must commit to being actively anti-racist in order to dismantle the centuries of systemic racism that continue to oppress our Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities.</p>

        <p>We are a concerned group of Fremont Unified School District (FUSD) alumni, students, parents, teachers, and community members. We recognize that systemic racism is a reality in FUSD schools. Black students in FUSD are <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/miseducation/district/0614400">3.4 times as likely</a> as White students to get suspended. John F. Kennedy High School is 40% Hispanic or Black, and has only <a href="https://www.publicschoolreview.com/john-f-kennedy-high-school-profile/94538">40% of students</a> achieving math proficiency, whereas Mission San Jose High School is 2% Hispanic or Black, and has <a href="https://www.publicschoolreview.com/mission-san-jose-high-school-profile">90% of students</a> achieving math proficiency. Only one of FUSD’s <a href="https://www.face.edu/cms/lib/CA01000848/Centricity/Domain/5132/AdoptedCoreNovels%202017-18.pdf">Grades 7-12 core novels</a> (5%) is written by a non-White author. Although <a href="https://www.publicschoolreview.com/california/fremont-unified-school-district/614400-school-district">89%</a> of FUSD students are non-White, only <a href="http://www.ed-data.org/ShareData/Html/38523">34%</a> of FUSD teachers are non-White.</p>

        <p>One of the most sustainable ways to enact structural change is through education. To build a community of active anti-racists, we must educate our youth about the realities of race and systemic racism in America, California, and Fremont. Towards that end, we strongly request that FUSD takes the following steps to integrate anti-racism education throughout all grade levels and subjects of their K-12 curriculum:</p>

        <ol class="main-points">
          <li><b>Form a diverse committee of students, teachers, parents, alumni, and community members to oversee the process of integrating anti-racism measures in FUSD schools.</b> In the spirit of transparency and accountability, the committee must release plans, timelines, and progress on accomplishing the following points with the greater Fremont community.</li>
          <li><b>Diversify curricular content.</b> All courses must include more content by BIPOC creators and must actively educate students about the realities of race and racism in America, past and present. Specifically, we ask that FUSD:
            <ol type="a" class="sub-points">
              <li><b>Diversifies the books read in English classes</b> to reflect the demographics of our city and nation. At least half of the books assigned in each English class should be written by non-White, and particularly BIPOC, authors, implemented in a phased approach beginning in the 2021-22 school year.
    </li>
              <li><b>Implements and requires an Ethnic Studies curriculum</b> using critical pedagogy. Critical pedagogy is a way of teaching that helps students challenge dominant narratives and practices. Ethnic Studies is an academic field in itself, and “<a href="https://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/">is the critical and interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity with a focus on the experiences and perspectives of people of color within and beyond the United States.</a>”</li>
              <li><b>Embeds anti-racism in all subjects.</b> Anti-racism should not be siloed into only one class. History classes should remove their Euro-centric and white-centric lenses and teach the historic and continuing systemic oppression of indigenous and Black populations. Math classes should learn about the statistics of segregation, redlining, gerrymandering, and generational wealth transfer. Science classes should learn about why there is no scientific basis for race. Physical Education classes should teach students about BIPOC athletes such as Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson. Art and music classes should incorporate the works of BIPOC creators and movements such as the Harlem Renaissance. To deconstruct the norm of whiteness that has been embedded into our curriculum, we must actively inject anti-racist perspectives into all academic subjects.</li>
              <li><b>Expands opportunities for students to interact with people who are BIPOC</b> through guest speakers, field trips, and civic engagement projects.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Diversify employees.</b> Students look to teachers as role models, and that is difficult when teachers do not look like them, do not share their cultural experiences, and lack the training to actively engage and foster students’ diverse backgrounds. Therefore, we ask that FUSD:
            <ol type="a" class="sub-points">
              <li><b>Diversifies new hires</b>, pursuant to applicable laws. We would like FUSD’s new hires for principals, teachers, counselors, and other academic stauff to be at least half non-White, and particularly BIPOC, implemented in a phased approach beginning in the 2021-22 school year.
    </li>
              <li><b>Actively recruits at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI)</b> and other institutions with a high proportion of BIPOCs.</li>
              <li><b>Incorporates anti-racism into the hiring process</b>, by diversifying hiring committees and including interview questions about how an applicants’ background can further the district’s goal of incorporating anti-racism into their K-12 curriculum.</li>
              <li><b>Mandates yearly anti-racism teacher training</b> which will cover topics including culturally relevant pedagogy, white supremacy culture, anti-bias, racial equity, and inclusion.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li><b>Reduce harshly punitive outcomes for BIPOC students</b>. American schools are well-known to perpetuate a school-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately disciplines and alienates BIPOC students. FUSD is no exception, with Black students being <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/miseducation/district/0614400">3.4 times as likely</a> as White students to get suspended. Therefore, we ask that FUSD:
            <ol type="a" class="sub-points">
              <li><b>Removes Fremont Police officers (“School Resource Officers”) from FUSD schools.</b></li>
              <li><b>Invests in programs that promote racial equity</b>, including culturally sensitive counseling services, child-care, and afterschool programs.</li>
              <li><b>Ends zero-tolerance policies that promote suspensions and expulsions.</b> These policies disproportionately target Black and Brown students and feed them into the carceral system.</li>
              <li><b>Investigates the racial gap in disciplinary action</b>, and publicly releases the causes of that gap as well as concrete steps they are taking to address it.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>With these actions, we believe that FUSD can begin the long path of embracing and actively encouraging anti-racism in its students and the broader Fremont community. We believe these steps will help FUSD achieve its mission “<a href="https://www.fremont.k12.ca.us/pf4/cms2/view_page?d=x&group_id=1524555033922&vdid=4ia17a1jujp9d2c5">to provide equitable opportunities to Educate, Challenge and Inspire students of all ages, talents and ability levels</a>,” and we look forward to continuing to engage with FUSD as they move towards these reforms.</p>
