# FUSD Anti-Racism Wesbite

To change the html, please change `template.template`.

To update signature counts, download the Google Form signatures as a CSV. The file `htmlFromTemplate.py` reads in `template.template` and the Google Docs CSV file (named `FUSD Anti-Racism Petition (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv` for now) and adds the names and numbers of signatories to the HTML. It outputs `index.html`, which is where the website is displayed.
